# Arcade-game-P3

In my Front End Udacity nanodegree, I had to code a classic arcade game based on the game Frogger. The point of the game is to get your character from the grass over the road and into the water. The challenge is to avoid the bugs that travel on the road. If a bug is touched, the character is reset back at the beginning. Upon reaching the water, the user is also reset back to the beginning.



# Some changes

*I added Mario character


*I added the enemy bullet


*And change the background

# How to play

The goal is to match is to jump into the water. Click in the following link to play: https://trook94.github.io/Arcade-game-P3/

Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, move upwards.

Try and avoid the cockroaches and try and jump into the water.

If you made it in the water, you can play again. If you collided with a cockroach, start again!
